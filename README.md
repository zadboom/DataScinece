# Machine Learning Prediction for SpaceX Falcon 9 Landings
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than the $165 million charged by other providers. This cost reduction is largely due to SpaceX’s ability to reuse the first stage of their rockets. If we can predict whether the first stage will successfully land, we can estimate the launch cost and provide valuable insights for other companies looking to compete with SpaceX. This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline to predict whether the first stage will land or not.

# Project Overview
In this project, we explore various machine learning models and techniques to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9’s first stage. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

# Tools and Libraries Used
# Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
# NumPy: To handle large, multi-dimensional arrays and perform mathematical operations.
# Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization, plotting trends, and analyzing correlations.
# Scikit-learn: To implement machine learning models, including preprocessing, splitting data, and tuning algorithms.
# Machine Learning Models Implemented
# Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective classification algorithm that estimates the probability of landing success.
# Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that finds the optimal decision boundary.
# Decision Tree: A tree-based classifier that models decision-making steps for predicting outcomes.
# 3K Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A proximity-based classifier that predicts a class based on the closest data points.
Workflow
# Data Preprocessing:
Standardized data using preprocessing to ensure uniform scaling.
Split data into training and test sets with train_test_split.
# Model Training & Tuning:
Used GridSearchCV to fine-tune model hyperparameters and find the best combination for optimal performance.
# Model Evaluation:
Evaluated model accuracy and performance using appropriate metrics and visualized results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
